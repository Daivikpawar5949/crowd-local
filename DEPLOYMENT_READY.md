## 🚀 Deploy in 10 Minutes

### **Step 1: Frontend to Netlify** (5 min)

**Option A: Netlify CLI (Fastest)**
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

**Option B: GitHub + Auto-Deploy (Recommended)**
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "CrowdLocal v1.0"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/crowd-local
git push -u origin main
```
Then connect on [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) → New site from Git

### **Step 2: Backend to Railway** (3 min)

```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
cd backend
railway init
railway up
```

### **Step 3: Connect Frontend to Backend** (2 min)

1. Get backend URL from Railway (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
2. Add to Netlify environment variables:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
   ```
3. Redeploy frontend: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist`

**Done! 🎉 Your app is live!**

## 🗄️ MongoDB Setup (2 min)

1. Go to [mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. Create free cluster
3. Add user + whitelist IP
4. Get connection string
5. Add to backend env: `MONGODB_URI=...`
